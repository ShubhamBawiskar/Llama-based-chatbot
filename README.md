# LangChain Integration with LLAMA 3.1 API

## Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of the LangChain framework with the LLAMA 3.1 model for building an AI-powered assistant. The assistant responds to user queries via a web interface built using Streamlit. By leveraging the LangChain library, the project simplifies interactions with large language models, making it easy to develop and deploy AI-driven applications.

## Features

- **Streamlit Web Interface:** A user-friendly interface for inputting queries and receiving AI-generated responses.
- **LLAMA 3.1 Model Integration:** Utilizes the powerful LLAMA 3.1 model from Ollama for generating accurate and context-aware responses.
- **LangChain Framework:** Leverages LangChain for managing prompts and handling API interactions with the language model.
- **Environment Configuration:** Environment variables are managed using the `.env` file, ensuring secure and flexible configuration.
